## The Programming Language

Geek is a "simple" programming language written in Python.
It is not a serious programming language (at the moment): it was born for testing my skills and because I was bored.

### Highlights
These are *geek's* highlights:
- quite simple;
- interpreted;
- stack based;
- uses [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (Revers Polish Notation);

### What you can do with *geek*?
That's 'what' you can do with *geek*:
- basic operations;
- assign values to variables;
- user input;

### Examples
**Arithmethical operations**:
- 32 9 + .
- 5.5 7 - .
- 33.568 0.300054 *
- 90 10 / .
#### Variables:
- pi 3.14 =
- r 8 =
- area r r * pi * =
- area .

#### User inputs:
- a $
- b $
- a b - .


## Notice!
- **Spaces** are really *important* in geek!
- The '$' sign is used for assigning values to variables.
- When you declare a variable, it isn't stored in the stack! Make sure you call the variable into the stack before.




## There are many errors in the code and even in the documentation. I will make changes from time to time.
